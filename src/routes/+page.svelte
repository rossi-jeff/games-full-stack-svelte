	<h3>Welcome Visitor</h3>

		The pages of this site are a collection of games written in typescript. They have <a
			href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a
		>
		backend and a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database and most calculations are performed
		on the server.
	</div>
	<div>
		The site itself was constructed using the following tools and resources:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte Kit</a> -
				<i
					>SvelteKit is built on Svelte, a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write
					breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you
					already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a love letter to web development.</i
				> (site documentation)
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> -
				<i
					>A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and
					rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.</i
				> (site documentation)
			</li>
			<li>Dice images downloaded from <a href="https://css.gg/">CSS.GG</a></li>

		Take some time to play a few games and think about the problem solving skills involved in
		constucting them.
	</div>
	<div>
		The register and sign in dialogs serve two purposes:
		<ul>
			<li>proof of concept for user management</li>
			<li>scores will show a username rather than anonymous</li>
			<li>you may continue some in progress games</li>
		</ul>
		No contact information is collected.
